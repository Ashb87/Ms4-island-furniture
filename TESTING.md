#### Site owner and Admin

  **1. the site to be attractive, responsive and easy to navigate for the user.**

  - To get feedback on the visual aspect of the site I have shared it with friends and family as well as members of the code institute slack community and asked them for their honest feedback. The feedback I recieved regarding the overall look of the site was very positive. The colour palette was very popular and the layout of the site in general recieved some really good feedback
  - Again I asked them for feedback on how easy it was to navigate around the site. With the clear links in the navbar and more buttons placed throughout the site to help navigate quicker, the feedback recieved was very positive. 
  - To make the site responsive I used the bootstrap grid system. This helps to easily achieve different break points for different screen sizes. To help test this as I was developing the site I was using chrome dev tools continuously so I could keep a check on how the site was responding on differnet screens. On top of this I also have access to a few screen sizes to test it on myself. These were an Iphone xr, Iphone 12, Samsung galaxy tablet, Ipad mini, and Macbook air. Each giving me a good example of how it can look on different screens with each screen displaying as I intended.

  **2. the purpose of the site to be clear to the user.**

  - When first entering the site the user is presented with a large hero image displaying differnet bits of furniture. 
  There is also an *about me* seciton on the home page giving a brief description of what the company is about. The *Island Furniture* logo link remains at the top of the screen the whole time and when clicking on any product link the user can see exactly what is for sale.

  **3. to add a product easily on the site.**

  - When an admin user is loogged in they can click on the *Product Management* link in the profile dropdown menu.
  From here they are presents with a form to fill in giving all the product details and the option to add an image.
  This has been tested many times and most of the products on the site have been added this way. I decided to only add a few products in development so that when I had installed the postgres database I could add a lot more whilst checking the functionality of it all at the same time. It works every time as expected with the product saving to the database and displaying in the correct category on the site.
